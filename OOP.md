### OOP vs Procedural 
* procedural uses a list of instrcuctions to tell computer what to do. it uses procedures which contains a series of computation steps to be carried out.
procedural programming also called `imperative` programming or top-down language. It is intutitive since it works as we expect how a computer should work.
Most of first languages are procedural like Cobol RPG II C Fortran. Procedural language expose data to external entities  
* OOP is made of a number of entities referred to as objects. Program is divided into objects and data is hidden from extenal entities and focus
is all about building blocks and objects. 

### Design Pattern
##### 4 authors wrote a book with a name of `Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software` which is known as Gang of four (GOF). According to them design is based on two principles
- [x] Program to an interface not an implementation
- [x] Favor object composition over inheritance 
##### There are 23 desgin patterns which can be classified into three categories plus one
- [x] Creational patterns: it provides a way to create objects while hiding the creation login rather than instantiation objects directly using new operator. 
- [x] Structural pattern: Conecpt of inheritance is used to compose interfaces 
- [x] Behavioral pattern: It design based on communication among objects
- [x] J2EE pattern: It specifies concerned with the presentation tier.
